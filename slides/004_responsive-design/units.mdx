<Notes>
  Let's talk about units.
  We've been using a bunch of different units in all 3 CSS classes we've had,
  and also there's been some discussion about what units are best.
  So first let's look at the different units that exist.

## Absolute and Relative
<Notes>
  There are two types of units, the absolute and relative.
</Notes>
---

## Absolute

- `cm`	centimeters
- `mm`	millimeters
- `in`	inches
- `px`  pixels *
- `pt`	points (1`pt` = 1/72 of 1`in`)
- `pc`  picas (1`pc` = 12 `pt`)

<small>*pixels are a 2x2px square in high density displays</small>

<Notes>
  A length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
  The most common usage of these is when the target media is print, except for pixels.
  Although pixels where designed for screens, their usage nowadays is limited,
  because screen sizes vary so much.

## Relative

- `em`	  Relative to the font-size of the element
- `rem`	  Relative to font-size of the root element
- `%`     Relative to the parent element

<Notes>
</Notes>

## Relative

- `vw`	  Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport
- `vh`	  Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
- `vmin`	Relative to 1% of viewport's smaller dimension
- `vmax`	Relative to 1% of viewport's larger dimension *

<small>*not available in IE11</small>
